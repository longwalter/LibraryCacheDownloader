# Rec Room LibraryCacheDownloader
Similarly to the one made by [Jegarde](https://github.com/Jegarde/RecRoom-Library-Cache-Tool), this tool will parse your Library file and obtain all sanitised links.

The difference with this one being that it downloads all of the images found automatically so you don't have to spend 8 years clicking them all :)

## Locating your Library file
The script should automatically find your Library file, however if for whatever reason it fails to, it can be located in Rec Room's AppData folder. 

This is what the path to there usually looks like:
- `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\LocalLow\Against Gravity\Rec Room\Library`
